# ProjectZ Menu - FiveM

**ProjectZ** is a personal project for learning the CitizenFX API in FiveM, using **LemonUI** for the user interface. It includes features like vehicle spawning, player options (unlimited ammo, skin changer, invisibility, invincibility, and GetAllWeapons). This menu is simple but can be expanded in the future.
